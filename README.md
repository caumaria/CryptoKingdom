To achieve this, the website is linked to the Coingecko API, a renowned provider of cryptocurrency information. Coingecko offers extensive data on numerous cryptocurrencies, including their present prices, historical price records, trading volumes, market caps, and other significant metrics. By utilizing this API, the website seamlessly provides users with the latest cryptocurrency prices and insights into market trends in real-time.<br>
